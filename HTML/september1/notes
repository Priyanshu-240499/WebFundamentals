                                         CSS BOX MODEL

Almost everything in html is by default surrounded by a box for ex. if we add border to <p> we are able to 
see it.It consists of few components:
1--content
2--padding
3--margin
4--border
NOTE:-use inspect to see in browser.........
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
content and sizing
if we dont give any width it takes the width to 100%. 
if we give width too small the cotent will get out of the box
The actual width is:      what we have given + padding + border + margin

extrensic sizing and intrensic sizing
if we provide width like 20px it is called extrensic sizing but if we did not have provided then intrensic
width:min-content
width:max-content(all content in one line )

----------------------------------------THIS ABOVE IS BOX MODEL----------------------------------------
                                          
                                          CASCADING IN CSS

When you apply multiple css to an element which CSS the browser choose is cascading:-
1--position and order of appearance => css added in the end will be applied
2--specificity =>the selector which has the highest specificity well be applied.It is actually a number which 
is calculated:
a=>universal selector (it has no specificity hence 0 points)

b=>type selector(h1)and pseudo element(::)both has 1 point but for pseudo it is calculated like
a::type then for a it is 1 and for type it is 1 makes total of 2
NOTE when you have multiple selectors score is summed up

c=> class,pseudo class,attribute selector=>10 poits

d=> id selector 100 points

e=>inline style attributes=1000 points

f=>id we add !importance in front of any css style it will override anyother css...10,000 points(IMPORTANT)

3--origin
a=>user agent style given by browser(least specific)
b=>local user style given by operting system like mac,linux,windows(medium specific)
c=>author style given by us(highest)
d=>authored with !importance
e=>local user style with importance
f=>user agent with importance
