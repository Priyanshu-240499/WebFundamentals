                                               CSS FLEXBOX
Its a layout mechanism.Instead of using inline or inline box, we use flex or grid because it helps in making our website responsive also

                                            Flex properties
1-- Flex-direction:: row(default),column,row-reverse,column-reverse

2-- Flex-Wrap:: nowrap(default),wrap,wrap-reverse(if content  is going out of page in same line,wrap helps to bring it in other line,otherwise no-wrap will diplay content in one line)

3-- Flex-Flow:: combination of Flex-direction and Flex-wrap(row wrap,row nowrap)

4-- justify-content:: (flex-start(default) flex-end flex-centre space-between space-evenly space-around) in copy

5-- align items:: arrange in vertical direction(stretch(default),centre,flex-start,flex-end,baseline)
baseline:all div will come in same line,like if we have different size of div then content in all divs will come in same line


6-- align-content:: it aligns the flex container's lines when their is some extra space.
In this flex wrap should always be set to wrap because it takes effect on multiline divs.
It will target entire content at once
It is a mixture of justify content and align items
