                                              JS 
We cannot have multiple constructors in js beacuse overloading is not supported and Constructor is a type of method(specialized)
We do not have access modifiers in js;
we do not have abstract class and interface in js


class, object,static-nonstatic,inheritence,overriding are supported in js

                                              Inheritence
parent class/base class/super class should have is a relationship between childclass/derived class/subclass

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                              Polymorphism
The process of defining same methods with different logic is called method overriding and any methods which 
follows overriding technique are called polymorphic methods
Only method overriding is supported in js

Real life example-I have a company and I developed driver for my app,now I gave third party people to develop the 
driver for my app, and gave them the instructions that they have to use the same function name in this way they
will use polymorphism and override their child drivers accordingly
