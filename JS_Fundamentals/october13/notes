Making objects using constructor is important because in other methods we are going to hardcode and then
 if we make second object then it will get values of first object.EX->product.js

 this is just a reference in javascript by default this will point to window object,window is the parent object in javascript
 Inside class we always access properties and methods using this keyword
 take notes of oops from sir github
